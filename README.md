Django_Video_Schedular
======================

The problem statement is:

Need to create a django admin where a user can:
1. Login using the credentials
2. Can provide a description, schedule time and local file path of the video to be played.
3. The asset will get uploaded on to the server.

Once the user has scheduled all the videos to be played, the Url will have to ping to a URL.
At that window, at the scheduled time, the uploaded asset will fet played in a HTML5 browser.
